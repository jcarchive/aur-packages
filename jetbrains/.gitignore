This .gitignore file ignores the pkg/ and src/ directories, as well as any .pkg.tar.zst and .src.tar.gz files that are generated by the build process. It also ignores common backup and editor files, as well as user-specific and system files that are not needed for the package.

Note that this .gitignore file assumes that you are using Git to manage your AUR package. If you are using a different version control system, you may need to modify the file accordingly.
