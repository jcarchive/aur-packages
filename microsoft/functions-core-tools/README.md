# Azure Functions Core Tools AUR Package for Arch Linux

Welcome to the Azure Functions Core Tools AUR package for Arch Linux. This package provides a set of tools for Azure Functions development, which are installed following a specific standard:

- Application files directory: `/usr/share/azure-functions-core-tools`
- Executable `func` directory: `/usr/bin/func`

# Installation
The installation follows the [official installation documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=v4%2Clinux%2Ccsharp%2Cportal%2Cbash) provided by Microsoft to install Azure Functions Core Tools on your Arch Linux system.

## Notes

This package may differ from the "official" package in the AUR repository in the directories used for installation and the installation steps. The purpose of this package, and others in this account, is to install all the programs that I use following a certain standard (i.e. using `/usr/share/{pkgname}` for application files and `/usr/bin/{execname}` for the executable) and in some cases, clean the installation steps from some bloat.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns about this package.
