# PowerShell AUR Package for Arch Linux

Welcome to the PowerShell AUR package for Arch Linux. This package installs powerhsell from the binaries in the official github repository.

This package follows a specific standard for installation:

- Application files directory: `/usr/share/powershell`
- Executable `pwsh` directory: `/usr/bin/pwsh`


## Notes

This package may differ from the "official" package in the AUR repository in the directories used for installation and the installation steps. The purpose of this package, and others in this account, is to install all the programs that I use following a certain standard (i.e. using `/usr/share/{pkgname}` for application files and `/usr/bin/{execname}` for the executable) and in some cases, clean the installation steps from some bloat.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns about this package.
